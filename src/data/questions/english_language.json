    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "In this sentence, the subject is 'students', and it's a plural noun. The verb 'to attend' should agree with the subject in number. Therefore, the correct choice is 'attend'. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they change the meaning of the sentence or do not follow subject-verb agreement rules.",

      "C": "The book is on the tables.",
      "D": "Books are on the table."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "In option A, 'majority' is a collective noun which acts as a singular subject and requires a singular verb ('is'). In options B and D, 'book's' is incorrectly pluralized. Option C is incorrect because 'table' is plural while 'book' is singular.",

      "C": "had given",
      "D": "is giving"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The subject-verb agreement rule states that when the subject is a plural noun, the verb should be in the plural form. In this sentence, 'new employees' is a plural noun and 'were given' is in the past tense, so the correct verb form is the third person singular present perfect continuous 'was giving'. Options B, C, and D do not match the subject-verb agreement because they are either incorrect tenses or forms.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer, 'B', means something that is easy to do. This idiom suggests that a task or activity requires little effort and can be accomplished with ease, making it a perfect fit for the phrase 'a piece of cake'. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they describe scenarios that are opposite of what this idiom implies.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct sentence should read 'The manager, who was responsible for the company's financial performance, had never been to a board meeting.' because it is a description of someone's past experience. The sentence does not imply that the manager has always gone to board meetings, but rather that this is their first time attending one. Options A and D are incorrect as they alter the original meaning of the sentence.",

    "explanation": "In English, the third person singular form of the verb 'to be' and many other verbs require an -s or -es ending when the subject is he, she, or it. The correct form is 'She doesn't like apples.' as 'does not' is used instead of 'don't'. Options B, C, and D contain errors.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B is the correct answer because 'also' is used to add an additional point or detail, whereas 'as well as' is used to introduce another element that is similar to the first. The sentence should read: The new employee was very happy with his new job also.",

The second blank should be filled with 'its', which is a possessive determiner referring to 'cat'.
