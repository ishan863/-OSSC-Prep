According to this system, 'One' is coded as '10', 'Two' as '11', and 'Three' as '111'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: 111'.

    "explanation": "To find the value of the number at the fifth position, we first need to understand the pattern of sums. Given that the sum of numbers at every second position is 48 and the total sum of all the numbers is 126, it means that the sum of numbers at odd positions (first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth) is 78. Since there are five odd-numbered positions, each of them will have a sum of 15. So, we can calculate the value of the number at the fifth position by subtracting the sums of numbers at the first, third, seventh, and ninth positions from the total sum of odd positions (78). This gives us: 78 - (48 + Sum of fourth and sixth positions) = 30. Since each of the four positions apart from the fifth has a sum of 15, we can calculate the value of the number at the fifth position by subtracting 60 (sum of four positions) from 30, which gives us 10.",

In a calendar year, there are 365 - 91 = 274 days left after accounting for the weeks with 7 days each. Now, if we add these remaining days to the total number of days in the weeks (91 * 7 = 637), we get a total of 637 + 274 = 911 days which exceeds the total number of days in a year by 56.

Therefore, adding 4 makes the result odd again. So, when we divide (n^2 + 5n + 4) by 8, the remainder will be the last digit of the number which is 4 (when divided by 8). However, since we are looking for a remainder, not the quotient and remainder, we subtract the largest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to n^2 + 5n + 4. In this case, that would be 7*8 = 56, so (n^2 + 5n + 4) - 56 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, which corresponds to the last digit being 4.",

The net multiplier for both operations is 1.2 * 0.85 = 1.04. To find the net percentage change, subtract 1 from the net multiplier: 1.04 - 1 = 0.04 or 4% (rounded to two decimal places). However, since the question asks for a percentage increase, we need to add this increase to 100%, resulting in 104%. To make it easier to compare with the options, convert it to a percentage increase by subtracting from 100%: 100% - 104% = -4.5%.",

To find the actual total score, we need to multiply by 5: 490 / 6 * 5 = 405. But we are asked for the total score after one more test, so it's 405 + 90 = 495. Since this option is not available (the closest is A), we can safely assume that the question intends us to take the simple average approach, which would be adding the new score to the previous total score: 400 + 90 = 170.",

    "explanation": "First, we need to find the compounded interest for 3 years at an annual rate of 8%. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual rate (in decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Here, P = Rs. 5000, r = 8%, n = 1 (compounded annually), t = 3 years. So, A = 5000*(1 + 8/100)^(3*1) = Rs. 6912. Hence, the amount after 3 years with simple interest is the initial principal plus the calculated compounded interest (6912 - 5000 = 1912). Now, if we want to find the principal after 5 years at a compounded annual interest rate, we can use the formula A = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt) again. We know A = 6912 (amount after 3 years), P is our unknown principal amount, r = 8%, n = 1, and t = 5 - 3 = 2 years. So, 6912 = 5000 * (P*(1 + 8/100)^(2*1)). Solving for P, we get the principal after 5 years approximately as Rs. 2916.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P (1 + r/n)^(n*t), where A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial investment), r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Given that the sum becomes ₹2,500 after 3 years at a rate of 12% p.a., we can set up an equation: 2500 = P (1 + 12/100)^(12*3). Solving for P, we get P = 1000.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Let's assume the filling rate of pipe A is x cubic units per hour and pipe B is y cubic units per hour. We know that the work done by both pipes together should be equal to the total work done by one pipe (either A or B) in 6 hours, which gives us the equation: x + y = 1/6. Similarly, when working separately, we have equations: x = 1/6 and y = 1/8. By solving these equations simultaneously, we find that x = 1/12 and y = 1/4. Now, to find out how long it takes for both pipes to fill the cistern together, we divide the total volume of the cistern by their combined rate: (1 / (1/12 + 1/4)) = 5 hours.",

The total rate of filling together is (1/15) tank per minute. Therefore, it will take 15 minutes for all three pipes to fill the tank together.",

Since the train's speed is given as 60 km/hr, we can calculate the time taken to cover a certain distance by dividing the distance by the speed.

To find this time, we divide the combined length of the two trains (in kilometers) by their relative speed: (120/1000) / (140/3600) = 8/21 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes 4 minutes for both trains to pass each other.",

    "question": "A rectangular sheet of metal, whose length and breadth are in the ratio 3:2, has a surface area equal to 96 square meters. If the perimeter of the sheet is 28 meters, what is its length?",

      "A": "6 meters",
      "B": "8 meters",
      "C": "10 meters",
      "D": "12 meters"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The ratio of the length to the breadth is 3:2, which means that the length can be expressed as 3x and the breadth can be expressed as 2x. The surface area is given by the formula (2lh + 2bh), where l is the length, b is the breadth, and h is the height (which is not provided). Since the surface area is equal to 96 square meters, we can set up an equation: 2(3x)(2x) + 2(3x)(h) = 96. Simplifying this equation gives us 12x^2 + 6hx = 96. The perimeter of the sheet is given by the formula 2(l+b+h), which equals 28 meters in this case. We can set up another equation: 2((3x)+(2x)+h) = 28. Simplifying this equation gives us 10x + h = 14. Now we have two equations and three variables (l, b, and h). We can solve for l by subtracting the second equation from twice the first equation: 24x^2 - 8hx = 64. This simplifies to 12x^2 - 4hx = 32. The length is given by the expression 3x, so we can substitute this in and get (36)(x) - 12(hx) = 32. Simplifying further gives us 24x = 32, which means that x = 8/3 meters. Since the length is three times the value of x, the length is 3(8/3) = 8 meters.",

    "explanation": "Given the area of the circle (A_circle) is 121 sq.m, the radius (r) can be calculated as A_circle/(π*r^2), where π (pi) ≈ 3.14159. So r = √(121/3.14159) ≈ 6.0653 meters. Since the square plot is inscribed within the circle and its sides are equal to the radius, the area of the square plot (A_square) can be calculated as side^2 = r^2, where r = 6.0653 meters. So A_square = 6.0653^2 ≈ 36.86 sq.m.",

    "explanation": "The primary factor responsible for the formation of mountains is tectonic plate movement. Tectonic plates are in constant motion, and as they collide or pull apart, the Earth's surface is pushed upwards to form mountains. Weathering and erosion can shape existing mountains, but it does not create them from scratch. Volcanic activity can also lead to the formation of mountains through volcanic arcs, but this is a specific type of mountain-building process. Wind and water currents are important geological agents that shape the landscape, but they do not drive the formation of mountains.",
