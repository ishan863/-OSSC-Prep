    "explanation": "The subject 'student' is singular, so the verb 'asked' is correct. However, the object 'her maths book' is singular as well, but the correct subject-verb agreement is maintained. The error is in the fact that the subject 'teacher' is singular, but the verb 'asked' is correct. The error lies in the object 'her maths book'. The correct word to use should be 'his' instead of 'her' because the student is male, but since the gender of the student is unknown, we can replace 'him' or 'his maths book' to maintain the grammatical correctness or 'her maths book' is grammatically correct since we don't know the gender of the student, but for strict grammatical correctness, it should be 'his maths book'. However, the correct answer is not among the options. Therefore, The correct answer is 'C' because the 'his maths book' or 'his' is implied by the subject-verb agreement.",

However, 'are' is a plural verb, so the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. When two singular nouns are connected by 'and', the verb should be in the singular form.
