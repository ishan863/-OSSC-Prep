    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The primary factor responsible for the formation of mountains is tectonic plate movement. Tectonic plates are in constant motion, and as they collide or pull apart, the Earth's surface is pushed upwards to form mountains. Weathering and erosion can shape existing mountains, but it does not create them from scratch. Volcanic activity can also lead to the formation of mountains through volcanic arcs, but this is a specific type of mountain-building process. Wind and water currents are important geological agents that shape the landscape, but they do not drive the formation of mountains.",
