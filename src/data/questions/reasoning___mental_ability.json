According to this system, 'One' is coded as '10', 'Two' as '11', and 'Three' as '111'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: 111'.

    "explanation": "To find the value of the number at the fifth position, we first need to understand the pattern of sums. Given that the sum of numbers at every second position is 48 and the total sum of all the numbers is 126, it means that the sum of numbers at odd positions (first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth) is 78. Since there are five odd-numbered positions, each of them will have a sum of 15. So, we can calculate the value of the number at the fifth position by subtracting the sums of numbers at the first, third, seventh, and ninth positions from the total sum of odd positions (78). This gives us: 78 - (48 + Sum of fourth and sixth positions) = 30. Since each of the four positions apart from the fifth has a sum of 15, we can calculate the value of the number at the fifth position by subtracting 60 (sum of four positions) from 30, which gives us 10.",

In a calendar year, there are 365 - 91 = 274 days left after accounting for the weeks with 7 days each. Now, if we add these remaining days to the total number of days in the weeks (91 * 7 = 637), we get a total of 637 + 274 = 911 days which exceeds the total number of days in a year by 56.

      "C": "No bank provides credit cards",
      "D": "At least one bank does not provide loans"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The statement 'All banks provide loans' implies that every bank has a lending policy. The conclusion 'At least one bank does not provide loans' is a valid assumption because the statement doesn't explicitly state that all banks provide loans, only that they do. Options A and B are incorrect as they contradict the statement, while option C is irrelevant to the topic.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The first statement 'Some books are novels' means some novels exist. The second statement 'All novels are thick' means all the novels that exist are thick. Therefore, both statements together imply that some thick books are novels (I) and some novels are not thin (II). Option A is the correct conclusion as it contains both implications of the given statements.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct conclusion can be drawn by using the given statements. 'Some books are novels' implies that there is a subset of books that are novels. Then, 'All novels are stories' means that all things that are novels (i.e., part of the subset) are also stories. Therefore, since some books are novels and all novels are stories, it logically follows that all these novel-books are also stories. Hence, all books that are novels are indeed stories, making option A the correct conclusion.",
