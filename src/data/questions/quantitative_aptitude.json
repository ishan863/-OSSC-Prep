    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Since n is odd, n^2 will always be a multiple of 1 (when n is square of an odd number). Also, n^2 + 5n is an even sum of two odds, so it's also even. Therefore, adding 4 makes the result odd again. So, when we divide (n^2 + 5n + 4) by 8, the remainder will be the last digit of the number which is 4 (when divided by 8). However, since we are looking for a remainder, not the quotient and remainder, we subtract the largest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to n^2 + 5n + 4. In this case, that would be 7*8 = 56, so (n^2 + 5n + 4) - 56 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, which corresponds to the last digit being 4.",

    "explanation": "Let the two numbers be x and y. Given that their HCF is 12, so both x and y must be divisible by 12. The LCM of x and y is 360, which means that 360 = (12 * k1) * (12 * k2), where k1 and k2 are positive integers. Simplifying this equation gives us 360 = 144k3, where k3 is a positive integer. This implies that the sum of x and y must be divisible by 144. The only option that satisfies this condition is A, which is equal to 324.",

So, we can write an equation as: x - 0.2x = 240. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.8x = 240. To find the original price, divide both sides by 0.8: x = 240 / 0.8 = ₹300.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "First, let's find the multiplier for each operation: for a 20% increase, the multiplier is (1 + 20/100) = 1.2; for a 15% decrease, the multiplier is (1 - 15/100) = 0.85. The net multiplier for both operations is 1.2 * 0.85 = 1.04. To find the net percentage change, subtract 1 from the net multiplier: 1.04 - 1 = 0.04 or 4% (rounded to two decimal places). However, since the question asks for a percentage increase, we need to add this increase to 100%, resulting in 104%. To make it easier to compare with the options, convert it to a percentage increase by subtracting from 100%: 100% - 104% = -4.5%.",

So, the difference in their ages now is A - B = 5 - 7 = -2 (which is not possible as age cannot be negative). However, when considering ages 10 years from now, we get A+10 - B+10 = 6*1 - 7*1 = 24.

Since the average score in five tests is 80, the total score so far is 5 x 80 = 400. Adding the new score, the total score becomes 400 + 90 = 490. However, this is an average for six tests, not five. To find the actual total score, we need to multiply by 5: 490 / 6 * 5 = 405. But we are asked for the total score after one more test, so it's 405 + 90 = 495. Since this option is not available (the closest is A), we can safely assume that the question intends us to take the simple average approach, which would be adding the new score to the previous total score: 400 + 90 = 170.",

The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual rate (in decimal), n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Here, P = Rs. 5000, r = 8%, n = 1 (compounded annually), t = 3 years. So, A = 5000*(1 + 8/100)^(3*1) = Rs. 6912. Hence, the amount after 3 years with simple interest is the initial principal plus the calculated compounded interest (6912 - 5000 = 1912). Now, if we want to find the principal after 5 years at a compounded annual interest rate, we can use the formula A = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt) again. We know A = 6912 (amount after 3 years), P is our unknown principal amount, r = 8%, n = 1, and t = 5 - 3 = 2 years. So, 6912 = 5000 * (P*(1 + 8/100)^(2*1)). Solving for P, we get the principal after 5 years approximately as Rs. 2916.",

    "question": "Two trains A and B travel towards each other at speeds 60 km/h and 80 km/h respectively. If the length of train A is 120 meters, how long does it take for them to cover each other's length when they pass?",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The relative speed of the trains when they are moving towards each other is (60 + 80) km/h = 140 km/h. Since the lengths of both trains add up, we can consider them as a single 240 meters long train. To cover this distance at a speed of 140 km/h, time taken would be (240 * 1000) / (140 * 3600) = 8 seconds",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The question is testing conceptual understanding of time, speed and distance. Since the train's speed is given as 60 km/hr, we can calculate the time taken to cover a certain distance by dividing the distance by the speed. In this case, the distance is 240 km, so time = distance / speed = 240 / 60 = 4 hours.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "When two trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds (60 km/h + 80 km/h = 140 km/h). Since both trains have the same length of 120 meters, it means they will take the same amount of time to pass each other. To find this time, we divide the combined length of the two trains (in kilometers) by their relative speed: (120/1000) / (140/3600) = 8/21 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes 4 minutes for both trains to pass each other.",

    "question": "A rectangular sheet of metal, whose length and breadth are in the ratio 3:2, has a surface area equal to 96 square meters. If the perimeter of the sheet is 28 meters, what is its length?",
    "options": {
      "A": "6 meters",
      "B": "8 meters",
      "C": "10 meters",
      "D": "12 meters"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The ratio of the length to the breadth is 3:2, which means that the length can be expressed as 3x and the breadth can be expressed as 2x. The surface area is given by the formula (2lh + 2bh), where l is the length, b is the breadth, and h is the height (which is not provided). Since the surface area is equal to 96 square meters, we can set up an equation: 2(3x)(2x) + 2(3x)(h) = 96. Simplifying this equation gives us 12x^2 + 6hx = 96. The perimeter of the sheet is given by the formula 2(l+b+h), which equals 28 meters in this case. We can set up another equation: 2((3x)+(2x)+h) = 28. Simplifying this equation gives us 10x + h = 14. Now we have two equations and three variables (l, b, and h). We can solve for l by subtracting the second equation from twice the first equation: 24x^2 - 8hx = 64. This simplifies to 12x^2 - 4hx = 32. The length is given by the expression 3x, so we can substitute this in and get (36)(x) - 12(hx) = 32. Simplifying further gives us 24x = 32, which means that x = 8/3 meters. Since the length is three times the value of x, the length is 3(8/3) = 8 meters.",

      "C": "56.23 square meters",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Given the area of the circle (A_circle) is 121 sq.m, the radius (r) can be calculated as A_circle/(π*r^2), where π (pi) ≈ 3.14159. So r = √(121/3.14159) ≈ 6.0653 meters. Since the square plot is inscribed within the circle and its sides are equal to the radius, the area of the square plot (A_square) can be calculated as side^2 = r^2, where r = 6.0653 meters. So A_square = 6.0653^2 ≈ 36.86 sq.m.",
